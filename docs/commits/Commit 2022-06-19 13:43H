Revised data transformation and created methods to do data preparation for timeseries modeling.

Warning:
    - No warnings this time!

Additioned:

    - src/resources/datatransform.py: conditions to filter the date in "derivate_int_float_columns" and
    created two news methods to derivated from the code in "check_transform_dateindex" for do both things
    separeteds and get these together in this method. Besides that, was created new methods to rescale datasets,
    to scale back, to test the rescaling method and for prepare a dataset to timeseries modeling.

    - src/resources/logger/logger_msg.py: new method to "needed to be" messages!

    - notebooks/data_eng_ml_model.ipynb: concluded the data preparation step.

Revised:
    - src/resources/datatransform.py: all this file was revised to having methods more easily to understand.

    - notebooks/date_eng_ml_model.ipynb: excluded some markdowns of steps who isn't divided now.

    - src/resources/logger/logger_msg.py: reduced log's file created time to one in a hour!
