New incomplete methods created


Corrected:
    - No buggies corrected today.

Additioned:
    - src/datanalysis.py: two new methods to plot all time boxplots 
    together and all time stabilities together.

    - notebooks/data_eng_ml_model.ipynb: new data analysis with boxplots
    outlier detector and times stability to understand the data.

Revised:
    - src/datanalysis.py: some methods to plot boxplots and time 
    stabilities was revised to a most clean code state.

    - notebooks/data_eng_ml_model.ipynb: some markdowns was excluded
    because it's not necessary anymore.
